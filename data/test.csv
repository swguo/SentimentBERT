does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a

They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket.
