How to restore my pro version?,2,0
"Wow... A To Do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring. I won't lie, I am absolutely baffled that this is omitted. Maybe it's in the web version, or the iOS version, but I'll never know... You tick a date in the calendar and... Where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx'? Maybe it's a premium feature, I guess I'll never know that either...",0,0
"I got this thinking I could use it as a gear 2 watch face. It's a cool idea 
but would be much better if I could use it on my gear 2.",1,0
This is one of the better Habit tracker app Ive tried. A couple of them I deleted after a few days just because they were So Basic yet had the Audacity to charge for a Premium Service. Habitica seems to be much more realistic and actually has a more detailed U.I for setting yourself different kinds of targets/habits. But I would like to give this app 5* once they link this app to your clock and calendar apps (or build in) & add more Notification controls. Looking forwards to updates....TBC,1,1
Reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient,0,0
"i want to love this app but lately after once i open this app, then the second time i want to open it, it just doesnt open i dont know why, so i need to keep uninstall and reinstall back and it annoyed me",0,0
"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!",1,1
It is really good and dies not have any ads also is really good for when tidying up,2,2
Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.,0,0
The sync feature doesn't work.,1,1
Loving how this is organized.,2,2
"I have been wanting to try out this app for a while. I registered, and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen. i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options. Will send photos if needed. Will change rating once this is fixed.",0,0
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.,0,0
I remember the days when you bought an app and owned it.. Now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity. I simply refuse to rent my own notepad.,0,0
Great apk,2,2
"smooth interface, but i didnt see where i can set a specific notification per schedule on my calender. it has one sound for all notifications in the calender.",1,1
What a genius game,2,2
"I like this app, but its useless. If i go on a different app, it just gives me a warning and carries on. Would be better if there was some sort of consequence for using other apps.",0,0
"Absolutely love this app and have been using it for months. Different lists in different screens via the widget. Unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now I'm looking for a new app. Will this be fixed ? Using Huawei p20 pro mate for reference Edit: I have reinstalled the app, taken the app off battery saver mode. When I reinstalled it is still the same, clicking on the widget does nothing, can't add tasks at all!",1,1
"Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens. I have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count. Or not, it kind of does what it wants at this point. I've mostly stopped using it because of this.",0,0
Fantastic and simple app,2,2
I bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month. I had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks.,1,1
It Is a very handy app but the fact that premium is required to enable reminders kills the productivity boost I wanted to achieve,1,2
Manage subscription is not given in the app menu,0,0
"This app is beautiful, and has really helped me keep my business, large family, homeschool and church activities all in order! No more chaos for this girl!",2,2
"Nice planner but you shouldn't have to pay to have ""week""view. I may not purchase now.",1,1
"It's a true mystery of life how Microsoft can take ANYTHING and make it look UGLY and NEEDLESSLY COMPLICATED. Why on Earth would they not simply leave Wunderlist as-is?? So they see nothing wrong, and decide ""Time to wreck it."" Who is going to save us when they finally shut Wunderlist down??",0,0
All I want is a calendar. This app spams you so much. 1 star,0,0
"A nice slick design, but ticked off tasks are displayed on the list of tasks I have to do. New tasks are also added to the bottom of the task list. This is annoying and I would like there to be a setting to adjust this.",1,1
"I had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up. Ever since then I've not got notifications at all, no matter if I try reset them or whatever. Kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so I keep forgetting to take my medication.",0,0
"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?",0,0
"This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium. Will delete before I pay for premium. Prior review: Migrated from Wunderlist seamlessly. Much more cumbersome compared to Wunderlist.",0,0
"Great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes. Premium isnt necessary, only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once",2,2
"Great app. I love this for my daily lists, shopping lists etc. I love it also has the sub lists with tasks. Would definately reccomend this app!",2,2
Exceptional!!! Works perfectly.,2,2
"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much. Wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but I'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline. Also would love to see ""weeklies"" or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like ""go to gym 3x this week"" or ""walk dogs 5x this week"". Integration of calendar events would also be nice.",2,2
Harus memasang kembali widget setelah memulai ulang agar data muncul. Sesuatu yang mendasar namun tidak ada di aplikasi ini.,1,0
Widget I add on home screen doesn't work when I'm offline.,1,1
"Can we have the lists back at the top of the page like Wunderlist, I don't need any of the options that take up the top half of my screen!",0,0
"this so help me to get focus ,youu guys much download this app ,see you guys in department of civil engineering bandung institute of technology i'll be there 📌",1,2
"Great app. However, I was not able to sync with Google calendar and it was a deal-breaker for me. Uninstalling...",1,1
Good,2,2
Those dots on the right of each item are gone. How do you reorder your to do items now?,1,1
"I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.",0,0
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.,0,0
"2 things would persuade me to make this my task list: automatic synching 
via Google drive, and an Ike-like view (a 2 by 2 table showing urgent vs 
important tasks). It's good to be able to categorise tasks into lists but 
equally necessary to know where you need to spend your time. Google 
""Eisenhower matrix"" for ideas. Would also love to see a Chrome app for 
desktop use.",2,1
"I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone.",0,0
"Loved this app, but recently noticed I really was't hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason, although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100% system volume for notifications, this version (BC2) sounds half as loud, if that, to the point it's unusable because I rarely hear them. UPDATE: Just realized that for some odd reason BC2 calendar notification volume is mapped/linked to Ringtone volume and I had that lower than half volume. Please fix this.",0,0
good app that does it's supposed to. wish it had some improvements to make it great (suggestions in the in-app forum),2,1
I wanted a to do list.. this is not such.. continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated ~ KISS,0,0
It alright,1,1
I couldn't understand it probably my fault but I find it complicate and I like to organize my day like without go and add on my calender just on this app but like I said it's probably my fault / gonna try this app again later maybe like after couple of different updates,1,0
"Their widgets had gotten better since my last review. I really appreciate the calendar with the tasks on the side! If there was a morning ""your day today"" or ""plan your day today"" alert in the morning, that would make it even better! I went to Any.do for that, but their calendar and sync to my waze app was off so I came back lol",2,2
"It is a great idea, don't get me wrong, but why the need for a chat room?",1,1
I have found this app helps me stick to my daily schedule.,2,2
Sometimes quits as it starts,1,1
This is the best to do list. Also growing your karma level is fun.,2,2
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.,0,0
"I just spent 30 minutes putting tasks into the app, then went to sync the app with my google account and they all got erased.",0,0
"Generally I liked this app but I found it very frustrating that I couldn't view all my tasks in one area, ie. Inbox. Or by by date. I had to go through each list individually.",1,1
"If you don't do any event today, it will not move to next day automatically. You have to manually click on event and give time and date again. I have to use task for this. I got it. It's good if time of tasks can also be shown on widget. Thanks!",1,2
Wow! I tried many apps like this. And in my experience this app is the best one! So easy to use! After other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect! You just click '+' and enter the name! That's all! Of course if you want you can add time and date and something else. I recommend!,2,2
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",0,0
Please fix the widget. It doesn't automatically update the day. It always shows yesterdays' date. Constantly having to remove and install widget.,0,0
"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.",2,2
"Love the idea but the app is so buggy and not too user friendly at points. First off, I can't change my character when creating an account because nothing pops up. It's just missing so I end up with a female characters. I have Galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope, seems to be just a bug. Also, changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through (the not user friendly part) The Good Idea is amazing! I really want this app to improve so I can incorporate this into my daily life.",1,1
"Mostly works well, but I am rather disappointed with the syncing issues my wife and I are experiencing. I'm unsure as to what Microsoft has changed from the ""Wunderlist"" app that I've been forced to switch from, but this app does not work as quickly and nicely as wunderlist did, which I had been using for 2 to 3 years constantly because it worked so well. Please revise this app so that connectivity problems from servers can be solved. I am unable to sync some/all of my shared lists.",1,1
"Used it in the past and wasn't too happy with it. Tried it again, and now I have no idea why I didn't like it before. I especially love the integration of the to do /task list within the app. I use the Agenda view on the widget and couldn't be more pleased. As the title says, I love it! Several years later and still living it. Wouldn't think of changing it for anything. Rating dropped from 5 to 3 stars. Too many features removed with recent updates.",1,1
The is no default free tree. There are trees for tokens but you gain tokens by succesfully growing trees but you can only have an initial growable tree by buying one.,1,0
"Have been using the old Pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much. Just started to use this new one not long ago. It has a more contemporary design, simplified and streamlined options, but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star.",2,2
It was decent but I remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress. Not very streamlined.,1,1
not quite what i need. otherwise looks like a decent app,1,1
Doesn't even come close to Wunderlist or Any.do unless you pay.,0,0
"Doesn't seem to work on OP 6T, can go through character creation, but doesnt let me customize or select anything. half of the UI shows up blank.",0,0
Only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to PAY for more. Always about the money. Sorry I wasted time on setting this up.,0,0
👍,2,2
"Migrating from Wunderlist couldn't have been more painful. First I had to open Microsoft account just for this app. Then, importing from Wunderlist messed up owners, all lists that were shared to me ended up as mine, I had to re share them to the original owner again. Anyone invited to the list must have MS accounts, I had people leaving because of this. And I don't get any notifications when people add new tasks. It may look the same as Wunderlist, but the app is starting to annoy me...",1,1
"Very good app for focus, has helped me on more than one occasion. I will say though, the audio it plays, if you choose to play it, sometimes glitches out on my Galaxy S9. It will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on. Otherwise though, its a very good focus app, great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones.",2,2
I have canceled for the subscription when at the first time i used anydo.  Do i still have to pay? i was try for free trial for the first i using this app.,0,0
best,2,1
Good,2,1
"This program does not work, PERIOD! Installed. Opened. Just sits there at the start screen, frozen and does nothing. No available controls or menu. Nothing. Do not use it. There is nothing to use.",0,0
"Too much spam. Stuff that I don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders I wanted the app for. Also, too many emails. I don't want more clutter to ""organize"" my life.",0,0
Does what I need it to do,2,2
Hi. App states its free. Yet there is a charge after 7 days. Dont mislead people,0,0
"Manca solo una visualizzazione in prospettiva degli eventi, che faccia capire bene quanto tempo occupano",2,1
I am facing sync issues. Yesterday I added a todo from my laptop chrome website. Today I didn't get it's notification on my phone. It's when I opened the app when I see that it's being added. This should have been done in the background.,0,1
"after few months it started not checking the task. I mean I check and few hours later it is unchecked. it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed, example: task 1 to date 01/jan/2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01/feb/2019. after checking the task for January the task for February should be displayed, but after some time the task for January is unchecked.",0,0
It never reminds even thought I've set the reminder,1,1
"I love this app! I can set times, and my tasks will appear in that order. I can set several reminders. When I click Done, the task goes to the bottom under Completed. The app keeps track of my productivity. I like that I can group my tasks in categories. I especially like that when I click on the date, all of my tasks automatically appear. I don't have to be overwhelmed by how much I have to do. I just take 1 task at a time. There's even a Promo timer embedded to help me stay on track.",2,2
So far I am enjoying it,2,2
"1) create 80 000 events to several exchange calendars 2) sync it with BC 2 mobile app 3) and you will see how ""perfect"" BC2 works All the time - ANR!! Thank you.",2,0
Very nice application!,2,2
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.,2,2
"Still missing some things from wunderlist. Notably email reminders which I really miss (not always convenient to get reminders on my phone or install the app everywhere), email item to inbox, better sorting (and as an added improvement please remember sorting by folder) and add new task at top of list. A bit early to be claiming you can now do everything you could as clearly you can't. But hopefully getting there.",1,1
No Sweet Thanks,0,1
I hate this app. Shared lists aren't shared unless you send an invitation everytime you update the list. I want my Wunderlist back!,0,0
"We are missing a chat feature AND notification when a task is changed / completed / modified in shared lists. Any.do is pretty good for my personal use but even though we are both premium, we don't see any possibility of interaction with the - kind of interaction Wunderlist provides not just tiny notification WITHIN the app.",1,1
Terrible app it didn't let me put my whole schedule in and it insisted me to buy the premium version which I'm not going to do 4.99 for an app that doesn't even work that well no thanks bye . And it restarted my whole damn thing like wth bch.,0,0
very bad experience,0,0
"Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size.",2,2
Please tell me how to use the app,0,0
1. I didn't get the desktop icon. 2. We tried sharing for shopping but it didn't sync.,1,1
"The app idea is great on itself. However, there are too many options blocked behind the pro version which one would think are basic: whitelist and exporting the progress (changing phones makes all the progress be lost). Moreover, although not essential, some free achievements would also be nice, even if they don't give any coins. I'm willing to change my rating if I see any of those changes, since like I said, the app is quite good already (free version feels like less than a free trial...)",1,1
"The app started crashing recently whenever I try to use it, I press a button and it freezes completely and stops responding, I tried uninstalling and re-installing, at first it went okay (for 2 days) the the same thing happened again! It frustrated me, I'm not sure if I'm the only user facing this problem but I sure hope it gets fixed 😔😕",1,0
Was a great app...but could not login..since last month so...bye bye planner pro,0,0
"Been using for about a year. Getting more and more useful every day. Works well across Android, iPad, and Windows 10.",2,2
Excellent idea. Great for visual based learners,2,2
Reminders should be available for all.,1,1
Unable to edit time for reminder. S7,1,0
"I really like this, however I'm not able to stay with it for long periods of time. This one and others I've tried and I just can't stay motivated....",1,1
"Very easy to use. I have the free version. Connects with my Google calendar and I share with my partner. I do have to manually sync through, as it doesn't update automatically very well. Overall, very happy with this app.",2,2
Ok,1,2
"This app is a great idea and I love all the features. However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet. I'm not sure if the app thinks I'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating. If they fix that it's 5 stars for sure.",1,1
Many times i've used the app for over 65 minutes and every time it'd just freeze and shut down when only 1 second is left. Doesn't plant the tree and doesn't give me the coins. I'm disappointed + upset that i still can't save up for the treehouse that i want.,0,0
"Highly user friendly, but the free version lacks some of the useful features...",1,1
"Great app, I really wish it had a break or timeout button for when I need to check a message or whatnot instead of making me kill the tree, but overall great app.",2,1
"Password reset is broken, cannot transfer it to a new cell phone. Think twice before buying this app. The habit-related side is good, however - this is why I bought it.",0,0
This app is actually good for daily routine. Things which I like :- 1. UI 2. Optimization 3. Functionality 4. Dark UI 5. No Ads 6. No charges,2,2
I really appreciate the format of this one. I just wish I could color code without paying extra.,2,2
Not Good App All u Need buy and clock facility not given,0,0
Pls add 24 hour view,1,1
It good,2,2
Kinda complicated. Still not used to it. I love the widgets though.,1,1
It is what I have looked for for some time. I wish it could sync'd across multiple devices.,2,2
"Missing some key features - having the ability to have the same task in multiple lists, and an 'undo' button to undo completions/deletions done by mistake.",1,1
Yes this is a great app. I like all the different variations and things I can tailor to my own needs.,2,2
This app is amazing. It would be better if the app was able to be used without internet though.,1,1
"Pretty solid app, does what it seems, but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to. Instead of going off at the time I set, they all go off next time I open the app. They never go off until I open the app, so they're useless.",0,0
This is a very creative app to keep me amused with my Versa 2 Fitbit and to keep me productive when doing tasks around the house. Excellent job creating this app keep up the great work!!Two thumbs up...👍👍😎🖤,2,2
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for....",0,0
"I'm only two weeks in and purchased premium and killing it (even more than usual) at work. I love this program! I mostly use it on my desktop but it's great for when I think of things after hours, am on the road with my boss or walking out he office door and someone throws something my way I need to remember.",2,2
"I have used many habit trackers over the years, but this was the one that most suited me. It's simple and effective, and even the free version is really useful, the only drawback (for the free version) would be that you cannot track more than 5 habits, but I don't want to follow that many habits either way so it was a perfect match for me!",2,2
After unlocking the tree with sufficient coins the tree is not changing and irt remains fixed in green colour,1,1
Wow its used for my studies great please also set some features like more alarams,2,2
This game/app is so easy to use and so much fun. Thank u so much for making habitica!,2,2
Sharing lists doesn't work nearly as well as it did in Wunderlist. Otherwise ok.,1,1
"Good concept, works fine , helps to avoid phone addiction. But the problem with this app is that it crashes everytime when updated. Several times I installed and then uninstalled it. That led to loss of data and time. Tried your way , not available in my device. Problem still persists.",1,1
"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.",0,0
"I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars. For example, if I have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in Google calendar, the events will not be synchronized with Sectograph. This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...",0,0
"Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with.",0,0
"I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.",0,0
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.,0,0
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",2,2
I dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference.,1,1
"Hard, to use",0,0
Great app...new adds not so much.,1,1
"love the tracking, love the accountability. I use the widget, but I dont like that you can't split habits into ""profile"" type structures. for example, an ""AM"" Routine list of check offs, and a ""PM"" Routine. maybe those and a list of habits you just want to complete daily at any time. that would be a game changer for me. I've considered other apps because of that one missing feature. I dont like how the widget groups every single habit Into one list. I want to split habits up between multiple.",1,1
"Long time user of this app, problem is it doesn't have a search feature. Or if it does I can't find it. Sometimes I forget where I filed my note or task (again longtime user) and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading I put it under, but if it had a search feature I could quickly find it and get back to being productive. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement.",2,2
"Do not have the account sync feature, how we backup data when we change device ?!",0,0
"Microsoft bought an already mature application, spent 4 years working on it, and this is all they have to show for it??? Perhaps they could add more technical resources to support the 2 high school students that currently support this product. Poorly integrated with Outlook. Simple... too simple. Has very few features or functionality.",0,0
The app is really good but there shouldn't be a premium version of this app it should be free.,2,2
All my habits ended on 29/12/2019. It was not linked to 30/12/2019. I dunno why?,0,0
"pretty good, so i can set my life straight on my daily good habits and positive impacts of my self motivation",2,2
I did like the app..after I'm reinstalling the app..what happens to my In app purchase..I had purchased the app..Rt now which I'm using is it the paid one or free one. Do I need to pay for premium again??,1,1
"Perfect... Simply... Perfect, this app flawless, I give 5 stars to this AMAZING app, it is SO simple, yet advanced, and SO adjustable to YOUR terms and conditions, I LOVE this app and I am NEVER going back to any other schedule 😍",2,2
"Easy to use decent integration. One major flaw in the shopping list, no way of entering quantities, schoolboy error!!",1,1
"Amazing App Now I Can Easily Remember Every Single Shopping Items, But I Can't Afford Premium 😭😭😭 Thank you So much Sir💕💕💕",2,2
I love it so far but is it usable over multiple devices? I am currently using it on my tablet and downloaded the app to my phone but when I try to sign in it says it can't find my email address.,1,1
I've always had issues with consistency and will power. It's very helpful when can see my progress. It even tracks the percentage of your success.,2,2
"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...",0,0
"I like the app. Except for some reason it now says it doesn't work with my account even though I can use it everywhere else. I've done all the ""IT"" things I can think to do. But to no avail. Guess I'll be looking elsewhere now.",0,0
"I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable",0,0

"The concept is good but the execution lacks. There are constant issues with server sync, and since the server side has priority, updates I make on the phone regularly get wiped out.

My wife already gave up on it and I will probably look elsewhere too",0,0

I'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them! Really terrible customer experience.

It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.",0,0

"Regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits. For someone like me who needs feedback, the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going. After using this app for almost two months I have been able to analyze and critique a few of the apps features. It would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do. In regards to the level of engagement I would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app. For functionality, the free version runs smoothly, is clear, and easy to use. For aesthetics, it is simple and convenient however I do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size. The information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources. I do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users. From my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4.1.",2,2

Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.,0,0

"So far it's a nice, simple app that makes it easy to organise tasks. I am a fan if the widget to let me see different lists, BUT when I switch lists, it often unchecks what has already been done which kind of defeats the purpose. If this could be fixed I would increase the rating.",1,1
"I like the new ""Jump Day"", and ""Insert Gap"" options, and the Advice/Delay dialog for multiple activities. The Undo feature is a great addition as well. I'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through. Makes it so much harder to use - it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way, and starting time is not that clear as before. Also, those activity/free time blocks take too much space, yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible. I'd prefer a more compact look. It would take a lot of time getting used to this...",1,1
"Fun for university students The only problem is they don't order the tasks by date, do you have to be careful not to miss homework.

Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.,0,0

This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement). Thank you for making my life easier!,2,2

I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher",0,0

not quite as good as Wunderlist for me... but overall decent and as I need to use this for work now (as wunderlist blocked!) I am trying to get into it broadly. premium features seem quite pricey.,1,1
The hourly reminders don't work properly. They show up sometimes and sometimes they don't. It's unreliable that way. Otherwise the app is quite nice.,1,1
"Really enjoy the app, probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with. Also, please set up a system of 'weekly' tasks, currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised.",2,2
"I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications.",2,2

"I really like this app, it pleasing on the eyes it's well-designed, has a lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app. I would suggest to add an ability for ""gold"" that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards, aka don't work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party. That way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever.",2,2

Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day.

Great concept. Reminders do not work and from some quick research it appears this has been an issue for literal years now.

Would have been nice to explore more features without having to go pro right out of the gate. I'm not down to pay for something that supposedly works without trying it for myself.

I accepted a 14 day free trial but changed my mind just straight away. How do I cancel? I go into my subscriptions in Google play but I do not find this app among my subscriotions. I suppose it will turn up there only when the 14days free trial is over. Pleas confirm how to cancel. Thanks//,1,1

The reverse should also be available, to drag out a sub task by taking it in between two tasks.",2,2

Great app to keep your timing steady.,2,2

"Love hate relationship. The app is great.. It nags and nags and @*! @@! nags per your settings until you want to kill it.. Dead!! And then again! But it does its job. The reminders are rude, intrusive, nagging, annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list. I HATE it.. But it's supreme for procrastinators, busy people, air heads, and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target. Phone/setting dependent",2,2

"good app, but not what im looking for. i'd like to be able to check items off my routine as i complete them, but i cannot do that. i do like that there are a variety of tags to choose from, and that i can create my own tags. i also like that you can clone a routine over several days.",1,2
"I'm a premium user and I've bought it for about 3 weeks now. However, I've realized lately that although the timer records the amount if time I've focused, the app doesnt record nor update my data, for example in the friends page it always says that I've focused for 0 minutes when in reality it's a couple hundred minutes already. Please try to fix this problem. Thank you!",1,1

Very usable. Occasional technical freak outs. Some shortComings in navigability and manageability,2,1

"This was a great app, a year or more, ago. The simplicity of adding and checking off tasks, without clutter of a bunch of fancy features, was it's strength. Basically, it was as simple as making a list on a piece of paper, with the added bonus of having reminders. Now, however, it requires more steps to add to-dos, and is becoming more of a complicated app, loosing the original appeal. As of some time ago, notifications also stopped working, which mean I will leave, after some 5+ years of use.",1,1
I liked it...nice features but not giving the colour changing option (premium only) is just cheap... I wish I can set my own music for my reminders,1,1

Only two things kept this from five stars: 1 - the reminder is set by default to 15 min and there is no easy way to turn that off or set it to another time. 2 - the events are colorless, making them less at-a-glance for looking up your plans for the day. Other than those two things, I've got no complaints.",2,2
It's ok. When we imported our list from Wunderlist the list was duplicated. My husband and I share a list for shopping. When we connected through this new app every item on the list was duplicated. Frustrating to clean up.,1,1

easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day,2,2
The customization screen at the beginning of set-up doesn't work. Tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it.,0,0
I really like this app to establish a new routine. I strongly rely on my calendar at work but setting it up for routines outside of work is tedious. At first it takes a moment to understand how repeating activities are set up but now it's a great tool! Feature suggestion: it would be also really great if you could include a habit tracker into the same app.,2,2
"As a taxi driver I do runs for two friends at all times of the day and 
night. I've downloaded loads of these things trying to find one that I can 
simply put in a job with a simple title like 'Bristol Airport Pickup', with 
the time I want to be reminded (not the time I make the first pickup) and 
one that I can add notes to for phone numbers, first pickup address and 
fare. Most importantly it must sound the notification even if mute is on at 
night and early mornings when ai am asleep. Every one I tried did the first 
two, none did the latter two. This one. It does let me add notes but sadly 
does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a 
big oversight - so it is of no use to me apart from runs when I am awake. 
Please fix tbis and I will hapily buy it. Please also add a feature so I 
can choose what reminder sound I want instead of it using the default 
notification sound.",1,1
Simple easy to use and attractive... I use it for block planning so very useful,2,2

Once recurring tasks are implemented completely this will be superior!",1,1

Awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of $5 its about $10 for me with tax included. Also I don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33% claimed discounted price very deceiving. Lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019.,1,0

Everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered-mind people like myself 😅",2,2
"Not bad but not great. Pros: 3rd party calendar sync, time line view, icons & colour options to customise. Cons: can't sync devices, no task list or tick box. More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look.

"Very Nice App ... But who really needs to be reminded of and check off things we do all the time in daily life? If something is important next week or whenever, we normally remember it without fail - or we write it down. This App, while very nice indeed, typifies and feeds society's obsession with mobiles and tablets - and it renders people even more stupidly 'dependent' upon help - instead of what used to be 'common sense.' 🤔",2,2
Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane.

Also i feel like having a bar at the top to switch between lists makes more sense than the way it is now. You should still give it a try if you need something like this because you might like it better than i did.",1,1

After years of using Wunderlist and organizing both my professionell and my private life with the App I made the switch to Microsoft ToDo after they announced that the Wunderlist Service will be terminated around Mai this year. (2020). First impression was good and after years of using Wunderlist I felt at home. But on the first day in the office came the shock: You can not manually reorder the tasks!!! Seriously? That undermines how I and I guess a lot of people use a ToDo List...,0,0
Events Disappear,1,1
"Even after several updates, the problem persists: Despite adding and sceduling tasks, the calender inside the app isnt showing any tasks at all. No tasks visible at all in the in-app calendar view.

"WTH?! I used Wunderlist happily for, oh, about 7 years!Complete BS! They make you sign in to an acct to use this. I will NOT BE FORCED to sign in so all my personal info is linked with all my private grocery and to-do list. Microsoft has enough of my info and I have been less than happy with the invasion of Cortana on my laptop. MS help is the WORST (besides Google). So why would I want this co. storing THIS level of my personal life in their database? F no! Deleting this app immediately.",0,0
Troublesome widget organization. When I tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed. Very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful.,1,1
"I like this app i really do. However one caveat i feel is that it can only sync to a gmail or the native phones calendar. Outlook calendars are not supported as far as I can tell.

"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking.",1,1

"Used to think it was a 5 star app but they keep making it worse (and worse). Specifically it wrongly interprets touch screen movements putting tasks in random locations rather than where you drop them, often the very end of all your tasks, so you have to waste time dragging it back, sometimes for dozens of items. Reminders bug me the moment I wake up & won't switch off. You only let me move a reminder 15m, 1hr, 3 hrs. So with a list of 20 things I get 20 reminders 3 hrs later. Annoying as hell.",0,1

There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row.",1,1
It's very nice view but I need also 'to done list' in which feature I can input what I did and review after that myself..,1,1
Good,2,1
I dislike the update but mostly I dislike that it was changed and I had to look here to find out why. If you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when I open it. I am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration.,1,1
Excellent and detailed beyond average love it!!!,2,2

Like Google keep have.  3- Provide database backup option with Google Drive and Dropbox.,1,1
Ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall,1,1
"This app is actually wonderful. I'm hoping you can add the ""forward"" and ""backward"" buttons on the widget (potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons) like we have access to in the full app. It would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then, say, click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time.",1,1

This is just great!! I saw my favorite youtuber using this and I was like what the hell is she using that enables you so much facilities like you are bound6to stay focused.

I love the idea but there are syncing issues.  Events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar.  They show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same.  Also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day.  I have something starting at 12:30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else.  It's confusing.,0,0

Looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone. I can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white. Went with LifeRPG instead.,1,1
"Thanks for the response. The fact that an event repeats should have nothing to do with the type of notification and I think there should still be a repeating icon if no notification is set.

"I would give this app 5 stars but I am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open. I pay the subscription for premium, and I love all the options in the app. But it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open, unless there is a notification in my notification bar that I can open the app with. This would be annoying even with a free app, but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous. In the 2 or 3 years that I've used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade.",1,1

"It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all. Honestly I think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed, because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work.",1,1
"I used to really love this app and I still do for its flexibility and functionality. I was considering getting the pro version but because I am a small business owner, it was not yet necessary. Since the recent change to the new add format, I am watching full screen adds and waiting for them to finish (oftentimes no skip option). The adds are so obnoxious that the first time it appeared I tought I was hacked. It's hampering my productivity and now it has also put me off getting the pro version..",1,1
Awesome app very helpful and does its purpose very well. Just wish it was free or a one time purchase.,2,2
"Excellent app, with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users. I love that it can be used across multiple platforms. That being said, it's super unreliable so I'd never upgrade. Repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day, needing to be marked completed as many as 5-7x before moving to the next day. Sometimes when you add a task it'll disappear; maybe related to server syncing. But not always, so you better remember (defeats the purpose)!",1,1
Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.,2,2

In fact I think that's a great idea, but I don't want to have to pay a subscription for a simple list app. I'd absolutely pay a generous one time price for it because the app is worth it, but I don't care for another subscription. I'll have to stick with the free version",1,2
The only drawback of this app is that you need to add events or tasks or routine to your Google calendar in order for it to show it in the app. It would be great if such events could be added on the app itself.,0,2
Very nice,1,1
Good,2,1
"I'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me. It displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank. The tasks are there tho. I can read them if I open them, or open the app. :-( You're not the only organizer with this problem tho. Android 9.",1,0
Love this app. My favorite part is the helpful and intuitive snooze feature on tasks. Quick preset time ranges or ability to get specific make reminders easy to manage.,2,2
There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro. There are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity.,0,0

"Looks like a good app. I've been using Wunderlist for many years. BUT, I miss a lot sending emails to To do list like I was used to in Wunderlist. I use this feature in Wunderlist and Evernote a cannot imagine living without it. Otherwise I would give 5*. Flagging in Outlook is not an option as I don't use Outlook.",1,2
"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists",2,2
"In the ""important"" category add option ""sort by group and list name"". Do the same for the widget. It is possibol to have important things from different category so categorising it in ""important"" segment make's it cleaner and easyer to track.",2,2

The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.,1,1
i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do,1,1
Its ok. I've started using it when I found out wunderlist was going to end and be absorbed by Microsoft. I've used wunderlist for years so its a change. What I miss most is being able to manually adjust how my items were arranged I don't care much for alphabetical ordering and going from oldest to newest or newest to oldest as the only other available options are a bit annoying. I liked being able to sort my items as needed on the daily but maybe that's just me. I love'd my lists and now meh.,1,1

"This app is wonderful! I love that it has an option for numerical input each day. It is also great that there are both individual tasks and continuous habits, as previously I have had to use two separate apps for this. I did pay for the premium version, but I like that the app still functions effectively even if you have the free version. I would love to have a visual of my progress in each habit for the past week, but that is the only recommendation I can make. Overall this app is perfect!",2,2

I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others.,2,2
Excellent !!!,2,2
Needed a replacement for Wunderlist. Looked at several disappointing options before finding TickTick. It has everything I liked about Wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of Wunderlist's annoying behaviors. It also did the best job importing from Wunderlist. The best alternative to Wunderlist. Period.,2,2
Cool planner visualization tool,2,2
"It was really good for helping me to get motivated for a few days, but when I shut my phone off the notifications stop coming until I open the app again, and check off something.",1,1
I just downloaded& installed this app. I was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp. Preferably using a button on the screen. This way I can time stamp different sections in my notes and activities. however I didn't find that feature. would love to see that in this app as it needs quite a few of my requirements.,1,1

I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED PRODUCTIVITY APP. MY REVIEW OF YOURS WHICH IS VERY LACKING: Dark theme is missing! This one appears to be for 5 year olds! Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.,0,0

Simple. Does exactly what I want,2,2
Awesome app very good at keeping me accountable.,2,2
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",2,2
"This app used to be helpful, now it doesn't give me notifications unless I open the app. When I do open the app, I am slammed with overlapping ""reminders"". I have tried everything in the settings, but nothing has helped. I like all the other aspects of this app, so it's a shame that the one thing I need it for doesn't work any more.",1,1
"Really very very great, useful and highly customised app. Above all it's free and developed by the World leader in customisation. Developer is so helpful to provide individual attention. HAPPY TO HAVE THIS GREAT APP.",2,2

Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,2,2
"Overall a decent Todo app. It does have some things or desperately needs. 1) why can't I see the event time in the list. I can see the day but not the time. 2) why can't I sort by time? Again, I can sort by date but I can't look at the list and see what's coming next",1,2
Its a good app but i dont understand how in the picture they got their timeline like all their routines all my one has is the days of the week and to make a routine you only get two additonal tags im confused how did they get so many?,2,2
The app is really amazing. It helps me plan my day ahead and it's super convenient because it plays u whatever that have been planned on the day like a recap moment. Thanks :),2,2
"It's good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities ex:C1 A4 B2 etc; we 
wouldn't know which to do so we suggest you have more of those .Thanks.",1,1
Actually... It's pretty darn good. Yes you pay a subscription for full functionality but if you have a lot of projects and other stuff to track it's worth it. I also have to say that I love that there is a nice Chrome extension/widget (whatever)... so nice to be able to work on the desktop as well. Yes OneNote is good but honestly TickTick is much much better for tracking tasks with due dates IMO. Cheers!,2,2

sync between gcal was so bad that I wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task. For almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform,1,1
I like it. Paying month after month for premium features isn't for me though.,1,1
It's better then the other apps I've tried. But there should a bottom where it says you couldn't do the task instead of just turning the task as an overdue.,2,2

"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in.

"Pros - Really good app in terms of productivity and usability. - Love how it's possible to colour code and label tasks eg personal, work, university etc. - Love that it syncs with my Google calendar. - Plus I love the app's UI. - I also like the focus option; Cons - I think the focus option should be more like the forest app and not allow you to go away from the screen/tree, otherwise the tree dies. - I also think you should be able to add attachments to events like you can with Tasks.",2,2
"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",1,1

DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,0,0
Not as good as its old version wunderlist. Especially when you want to upload and download files through this app.,2,2
Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,2,2

Apparently I rated this app one star this time last year but I don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving  the app is good.

Monthly payments are for bills, taxes, video subscriptions, vpns, maybe even online storage subscriptions, but most definitely not calendars or to do lists.

"While it certainly wasn't expensive, it was a waste of money in the fact 
that I found this app to do very little more than any calendar. After 
reading the FAQ, it says it's more than a calendar... How? Especially since 
adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event. The 
""routine"" function is a missed opportunity in that I think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat, a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there. When I think of ""tuning my time spent"" I'm thinking, 
better organization for smaller tasks. Then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that I was never actually notified about

"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",0,0

Apparently I rated this app one star this time last year but I don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving  the app is good. Unfortunately I'm heavily dependent on having a calendar view(not Google calendar integration but rather an option to display days via calendar) so until it's put into the app I will be uninstalling and standing by for the update.,1,1
It is awesome. Definitely recommend 💜,2,2
The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests. For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered. would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,1,1

So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",1,1

Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,2,2

I love the app But its shame that I can't add my tasks on my calendar after I planned my day. I am heavy calendar user I use it to schedule every hour of my day but I can't do anything similar with this app except to remind me at certsin time. To me having to see how your day is structured by the hours is really usefull. Uninstalling it for this reason.😏,1,1
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget.

Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,1,1
Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings..

Update: After getting a response from the developer I would change my rating to 0 stars if possible. These guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all. I'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them! Really terrible customer experience.

I really wish the calendar was available for non-premium members,1,2
"was working fine for couple years. Now... 1. it creates duplicates of repeating events 2. while trying to change notification sounds, it switched to silent with no way to restore 3. FAQ to allow single repeated event deletion says to sync to get 'only this event'; but 'sync now' closes menu w/o synching",1,1
"Nice calendar app. Using it with several active sync calendars. However, intermittendly it happens that some or all events show up twice. Only solution is to remove the account and recreate it. It's annoying when you have more than one calendar account. We have four...",1,1

Useful,1,2
"Wouldn't it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications? It's easy to miss a notofication. Also, why can't we edit a specific day for a repeated event, but we have to edit also all future events or nothing?",1,1
"WOW I REALLY LOVE THIS APP!!! Such a great idea. I first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility & organization, we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress. I generally enjoy this game, it is the only one have on my phone.",2,2
So far it is good. But however i hate it when it still lags,1,2
Good idea but this isn't for me. I am much more for classic habit apps.,1,1

"The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star.",0,0
"It's not a bad app but I find it too cumbersome to navigate, I would have liked a simpler display of tasks, visually and organizationally it needs work.",1,1
I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.,2,2
This app is a very playful app. I use this app as a game. But I have faced some problems using this app. I can use other apps (phone based app/given by phone authority) while 'FOREST' app is active in the background. But on some apps (the apps I have installed by myself ) the forest app does its job. When I get into other apps the tree I have planted on FOREST app should have died but the forest app is not working on phone based app/given by phone authority.,1,1

"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !",2,2
"Useless. Have to pay a subscription to be reminded? No thank you. Honestly a once off fee is fair, but a continued yearly fee. I can see why these guys partnered with Facebook and mark Suckerberg . To suck your wallet. I gave it 3 stars because it is a well made app.",1,1
"Great app but missing integration with goggle assistant or automatuon apps like IFTTT, many apps do this now ticktick is falling behind",1,1
The full screen ads are intrusive and seriously hinder the free version's usability. Before the ads this was a very solid and handy calendar app.,1,1
This was OK for a few days but now  when I open it it is just a blank screen and I have lost all my  tasks. Very annoying as these were important reminders !,0,0

"The most user friendly to do list I've ever had, and I've tried a few! I love the colour coding of each list, the push notifications which you can snooze for various amounts of time are spot on. It's definitely worth trying this if you want to get organised with ease. Now I've been using it for a couple of weeks, I have one thing that would be useful, it would be even more awesome if the snooze options included something specific such as 'tomorrow 8am', 'tomorrow 6pm'. Still an amazing app!",2,2

Like it a little even bought the pro version. But when I went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone.,1,2
"A to do list is a really clever way to look into progress you have made in a day so, it is not just about completing the task it is about looking into the progress you have made by glancing at completed tasks. You don't get default features to see the competed tasks to enable that you have to go into settings and enable that and if you are not interested in compiled tasks anymore you can't just delete those tasks for that you have to select each task individually and then delete it.",1,1
"This is not a multi-protocol task manager as the description false implies. This is a front end to their service. I couldn't get past the first screen because it requires me to set up an account to sync. I use a private server capable of syncing things like tasks, Exchange. Most public clouds (Google, iCloud, Office365, email providers) have this capability, therefore why should I need to send my data elsewhere if it's already on a server. The fact that data is not something you can touch doesn't make it less valuable. Be mindful of it, it *is* our most valuable asset today, it may not be tangible but it sure can be quantified endlessly. Requiring signing up for any app is a huge red flag.",0,0

"I've tried quite a few rpg-like to-do list apps and I must say this one is the only one that I find genuinely enjoyable, and actually kinda feels like a game. You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.",2,2
"Simply the most delightful app I worked with for my tasks. It's minimal, but it has a wide range of features, specially how we can repeat a task anyway we want. That's exactly what I was looking for.",2,2

I have upgraded to premium version. In the last few days of my trial, this app has substantially increased my productivity.

Great app but tried backing up and restoring for a new phone and got a version mismatch error with no option to convert it. No mention of this beforr backing up. Disappointing.,1,1
"The app is good.. But we can overide this by changing the system time manually to future..

"I like the app and it works to improve my productivity, but the notifications almost never show up and the whitelist mode doesn't work sometimes. I wish there was a way to change the ground color for the day/week/month, and it's quite annoying that the flowers are as big as trees.",1,1
This app used to be brilliant. It then began to function regardless of whether you were using your phone or not- essentially just becoming a basic timer. And then now the timer fails and kills trees when youre not using your phone. I just planted a tree only for it to die 20 seconds after when my phone locked.,1,1
Loving it. Would appreciate dark mode as well!,2,2
"This app is very useful. Minimalist, yet almost everything is available. I could group my activities sub-activities and tasks as per my wish and use them to plan accordingly. A calendar option would make it complete.",2,2

"The notification bar does not work. The ""Add Task"" option appears, I enter the task and click on the icon, there's just a progress spinner. The ""Close"" icon does not dismiss the notification bar either. How inconvenient. Had this issue in Oreo too. Right now I am on Nougat. Also the animations inside the app are slow. The icon where you tap to 'tick' the task is very small.",1,0
I bought the premium version of this app. It is easy to use and I love the reminders sent to my Galaxy watch to keep me on track. I would like bolder colour coding to differentiate the goals being tracked and success/failure indicators. Overall a great purchase.,2,2

"One of the best apps I ever liked. But I can't control my anger right now. If there is a limitation of 5 real trees then why didn't you mention it on purchase page????? Why nowhere you have mentioned that we can plant only 5 trees maximum. If you are going to plant only 5 trees with the money we paid, cant we use the same money to plant 5 in my neighbourhood?

why would tasks be tabs instead of a list? the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs :O,0,0
"I paid for the pro version after playing with the app for a few minutes. Was hoping to use this to help manage my ADHD but I have two big issues with the app 1) I can't find a way to edit routines after they've already been created WITHOUT deleting the whole day. I don't think there is. 2) After I clear a day, the app shuts down.   I can deal with the second issue until an update but I don't think I would have purchased the upgraded version if I would have been aware of the first issue. Still, three stars because other than the glitch & missing feature the app does exactly what it says it will.",1,1
Love this app!!! It's so easy to use. It helps me be organized with the option of having multiple lists. Plus....it's colorful!!,2,2
One with a calendar view would be helpful,1,1
"This is the free version. The paid version is $7.99, the Platinum version is even more. You can only track 5 habits in the free version. Developers must be paid, but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable. (I should charge for this.) Do not install. #doughymiddle",0,0

"It's very useful so far, however I'm not sure if you can change your daily routine. I made one for Monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week, whereas I need them different and when I go to try and add a new task to my day that I want, it changes it for all of them. Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.",1,1
"The app works only if you do not press ""Clear All Apps"" while the App runs. The moment you clear, you can shuffle between other apps and use it as long as you dont reopen the Forest App. The app starts running again, once you open it and it blocks other apps. This needs to be fixed!",1,1
"Wunderlist is the best for me. If you would like to change wunderlist to be Microsoft To Do, please take all wunderlist's features.

"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.",0,0

Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.,1,1

Other then that, I think the app is awesome!",2,2
"Edit: Reply from developer says sorry if they ""offended my feelings""? Really? This isn't a dispute about feelings. To suggest such is a fallacy. Personal attacks are not welcome when discussing dislike of your pay model. Original: Everything is extra. 24h mode, colors, any default functionality will cost you more! Bad model!

"Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird.

With the short period of time I've used this app I have enjoyed it. The app has been a great tool to help my keep track of my 2018 goals and stay on top of new habits I am trying to create to better myself and future. it has a clean UI although i wish it had more theme options. This app has been great at motivation on days o have slacked off or days I messed up with its visual aid on my progress for 2019. I would recommend it to someone trying to create a better habits.,2,2

"I love this app so much, I've had it for almost a week and I've only found one bad thing about it. It's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so. The problem I've had is that when I get video chat requests from Instagram my trees die but I fixed it by muting video chat requests. Overall it's super fun :)",2,2

Very bad app,0,0
"I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.",0,0
"I loved this app for a long time, however since an update early in the year the app keeps killing my tree randomly part way through the timer despite me not unlocking or sometimes even touching my phone.

When it works it's great!",1,0
"It's a good start...I currently have a 1 month subscription. Needs more habit type features. Needs to track , display and keep a record of current and longest streaks. Repeat option needs much more options like; 1. A way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day. 2. Repeat week, should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days. 3. Achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days.",1,1
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.,0,0
However there are a few bugs. Every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and I have to delete it. The synchronization with drop box isn't good enough to use on two devices. I would be useful if you could choose 'third Sunday of every month' for recurring tasks,1,2
Its the best app when it comes to tracking your progress but one problem thats why i didnt give it a 5 star when you set reminders it doesn't work maybe on my phone but it doesn't send you reminders.. besides that its really a good app to kick start 2020,2,2
"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine.",1,2
It crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment. Why not just make it $5 lifetime? Seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar.,1,1

"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work.",1,1

my mobile is getting switched off after installing.it worked fine on 1st day of installing. please fix it,0,0
I was using Wunderlist but this seems to be a great replacement. It integrates very well with Outlook 365 and the reminders are easy to manage. Would certainly recommend it for anyone looking to manage task lists.,2,2

"Have been using the old Pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much. Just started to use this new one not long ago. It has a more contemporary design, simplified and streamlined options, but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star.",2,2
This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,2,2
I really like this app. Getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version. It has helped me with my productivity as a sales professional and given me more control of task that need to be done daily to often get forgotten. I recommend this to anyone that find using a to do list helpful.,2,2

"Very helpful and useful. I made use of the widget very often, but it stopped working and only started back to work when I uninstalled and then reinstalled the app. Otherwise, this is is a 5-star app.",2,2
"Mostly really good, great for sharing tasks between people/phones/desktops, but the widgets on Android keep clearing themselves and have to be re-added to work again, and repeating tasks constantly change the day they alert you on, reminding me the day after or before I set them to. I keep having to edit them back again. Really frustrating. What's the point in a daily reminder if it keeps changing to try and alert you the day before it existed? Edit: and again, anytime there's a clock change!!!",1,1
I downloaded S.Graph but I do not have any widgets with it. I have google calendar. I can open the app but there is no Home screen widget. Any way I can fix that? I have a Samsung S6 Active. Thanks a lot!,1,1

not a bad app but the worst customer service and thw widgets dont work once you pay for premium! just use the free version. your more likely to succeed if you focus on less goals at one time anyhow! DONT BUY PREMIUM!! WHEN IT TURNS OUT IT DOESNT WORK YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GET A REFUND!,0,0

EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless..

"Actually a great app, I'm migrating from Wunderlist, and I love the option to add tasks from other lists to ""My Day"" and focus on just those. The 3 stars are from glitches that I'm experiencing, that just make it troublesome for smooth working. First is the ""from today"" tray that keeps coming up endlessly, needing me to force quit the app, only to have it happen repeatedly. Secondly the widget that doesn't update either tasks I've added, or tasks I've marked as completed in the app.",1,1

"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps.

"I cannot givey opinion, because I cant install the app.",0,1
"Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit.

"I love this app ; the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense. Sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors. Also I've found the colors are very limited. When it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events, it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color.",1,1

I also would like a printing feature for my lists so that I can actually print them out while packing.",2,2

"Mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly, why can you do it from only projects? Why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right (to much marks is completed) allow a simple option on the menu.

Not as good as Wunderlist. Simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as: 1. sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to My Day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened - makes adding lots of pages in a row slow. 2. Add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top. 3. Marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list. Other than that it looks smart and imported my old Wunderlist lists on 2nd attempt.,1,1

I loved TT and paid for Premium but sooner or later their reminder will let you down :( You can't count on it unfortunately. And it's not because of Android but due to a flaw in the app. If a reminder pops up and you accidentally tap somewhere else in the screen or if you're busy now then the reminder disappears and never reminds you again until you manually find this task again in the list and set a new date for the reminder.,1,1

Functional but not very stable.,1,1
"Checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single, scrollable homescreen widget. --- Unfortunately, although the app has the option to repeat a task ""from the completion date,"" the functionality is broken.  For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the ""Thursday"" and the ""from completion date."" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work.",0,0
Purely task management; not Google Keep Competitor. I'd switch today if I was able to create quick notes as well. OneNote is too rich in features and has too heavy of a UI navigation to be a valid alternative. It's not stepping on OneNote's if it were to have this added.,0,2

"I think the app is very good, has helped me to keep track of my habits. However I wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control i.e. not going to the gym because you're on holiday. This although a break from the habit doesn't feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit. Also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week?",1,1

"Really nice clean UI and smooth UX, not laggy at all. You can divide tasks in groups and sub groups, and attach a due date to it and tell you when the task is overdue. The second best thing about this app is the ""plan"" app feature. The feature shows what task you have planned for the day and shows you the task one by one and lets you pick when to do it. Very nice feature but how many times you can plan your tasks is limited in the free version. I wish there's an integrated ""Habit App""feature",2,2
"Just upgraded to Android 10. Re-evaluating. So far so good. Though pop ups are gone due to Android 10 architecture, I don't miss them.

I'm using the app couple of years and i really nice. It just really annoying when the reminder message pops up while you type a message or during the call (while hanging up...),2,2
Very good calendar. Syncs well easy to use. Just wish it had grouping option so I can tell what sort of appointment I have at a glance. Apart from that very good,2,2

"Excellent and useful! I wish I had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too. Occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back. The outside clock face numbers are only black? Can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them. The widget palette is great, but I can imagine customization with background images of clock faces, different hand shapes, and/or color gradients to make it look really impressive!",2,2

"You have to pay to pay monthly sync across devices, it should be a one time cost. Edit - You know what streve, I was greedy, everthing else is free. but interdevice sync is a standard in most apps, so the lack of the option is a real down side and now I have to switch app, and it's not that I'm not willing to pay. I just want it to be a one time cost and I still won't pay the price for your years subscription even if it was for a lifetime of use. So I'll give you 4 stars but leave the app.",1,2
Good app,2,2
"Excellent app, excellent widgets. I use this with widget as my daily habit manager. Could do with an update and could have other features but what it does (help maintain habit streaks) it does better than any other app I've found. I bought premium one off to use the apps.its worth it for me. Don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it. Free to use though, only widgets are premium",2,2

Just add 'To Do List' feature. Highly recommend.,1,1
I don't know if a Google update has rendered this app useless for reminders but I no longer get reminders for important events. I now have to go into the calendar app itself to view what is coming up. I'm sick of apologising to people for missed appointments. I use a Note 4.,0,1

A bad version of Wunderlist.,0,0

"Perfect except for one thing. The 'I want to...' button at the bottom of my to do list sometimes blocks the bottom item on my list, making it more difficult to cross off. There is already an add item button on each list category, so I think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it.",2,2
Bought premium. Exactly what I was looking for. Amazing job and what I need to help me in life. Giving it 5 stars even though I have one suggestion. Possibly have it where you can have a single habit occur twice. Like say example I want work out but I want to work out at 3pm and 7pm. I saw another app have it but still this one is best hands down.,2,2

"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar",1,1

I like it and to be honest for a free app it's Pretty good. My only gripe is that the home screen widget doesn't update. However it's good enough for me to leave tick tick !,2,1
"Really great app, fast and snappy like a to-do app should be like so you don't miss any thoughts, my biggest issue with this app is that there is no one time pay to buy option for it, while I find it useful I don't need a lot of the pro features, I am a basic user and need it just to track my personal tasks, as such the monthly payment subscription for the Pro version does not make sense to me, why not add a basic pro model, with limited features, that users can outright buy forever.",1,2
"The recent UI changes are not intuitive. And the snooze options still suck. Why can't we have a simple 3-digit numerical entry field, plus a period selector with minutes, hours, days, months, etc.? The Life Reminders (LR) app has much better snooze options, and time/date entry options.",0,0

I love making lists and this application makes it much more accessible to do so... 🟢I don't have to worry about which pocket my hand written list was last put into. 🟢I don't have to worry about keeping a pen on me or losing it in the store for the tenth time.

Deceptive billing practices - information on cancelling is circular; emailed a link that advises to email. Doesn't have colour tag functionality across web and app; very poor UX and worse customer service.,0,0

"There's no option to remove time rows in the widget, only an option to remove the time bar which is kinda pointless. Was hoping for a simple layout for the widget to display only days (7 days) without all those crowded rows of time displayed. Would otherwise give it a 5 star.",0,0

"Great for maintaining and keeping a routine. This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right. It is a bit tedious for some people, (that's why the 4 stars) but they can keep it simple and high-level if they like. But, if you really want to tame that beast called your work week, school agenda, or personal days like me, this will take care of it.",2,2
"I like the layout and it looks promising but I have at least 20 Google subcalendars so I can color code things and keep them separate and it can, at best, display part of 1.

"This is the best time blocking app I've found, but it still has some significant pain points.

"Love the app, I've signed up to premium a year ago and I'm continuing my subscription. I'm using the getting things done (GTD) methodology with this app. A feature idea: allow users to choose when ""today"" ends or when ""tomorrow"" starts. E.g. my day doesn't really finish at midnight every day, I consider my day finished when I go to sleep, which sometimes can be at 3-4 am. So I would choose 6 am to be my ""tomorrow"" so those tasks don't mess up my to do list on nights when I work late.",2,2
"This is a step down from Wunderlist. Before deprecating Wunderlist in favor of this app, it should atleast have been brought to parity.

In the sharing with SMS option, the link and the text together require 2 texts. Why?!. Unhappy.",0,0
I just downloaded it to see the continuity of work I do. I found it personally useful. 1st : I am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit. which I wanted to continue. 2nd : Now I can read the comments I entered after finishing the tasks.

"I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator.

"I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed.",0,0

How can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop. I have looked to see where the notes save to but can't seem to find them anywhere. Please help me,2,1
"So far, so good. I love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day, rather than just once a day. This has definitely helped me develop a routine. I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that.",2,2
"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.",2,2
"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.",2,2

NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,0,0

The android homescreen widget keeps on hanging every now and then. I'd have to remove the widget and then add it again to the home screen to make it work. It's really a headache. I may opt out of the app if the widget continues to behave like this. Google calendar was what I was using before and that worked completely fine.,1,1
"Good app overall but still doesn't recognise the date of reminder from plain text, this needs to Improve",2,2

I also found that trees die if I dont come back fast enough after my timer expires? Like if I set my timer for 1 hour and I come back in 2 Ill find the tree died, thats weird, is that a bug on my end?

Good app for daily planning.,2,2
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.,0,0
Absolutely essential to my law practice! Full featured yet extremely intuitive to use. Syncs perfectly with Google Calendar. One of my earliest & smartest app purchases as soon as I took the Android plunge.,2,2

Good,2,2
The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.,1,1

"I like the app. Have been using it for a few months now, and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track. Only drawback I've found is the inability to sync my profile - always fails with 'sync failed, make sure you have a working internet connection'. Have sent in support request, but so far no response. That aside, the app works well, and I can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary Android phone.",2,2

"Like the concept, but was hoping to see the full widget on my phone. Unfortunately does not display like the screenshot you show above on a samsung s7 edge (not sure if it is settings i need to change). I would also like better integration with microsoft outlook. Currently it takes me to the calendar but none of my meetings show up on the widget. Integrates well to samsung planner and google calendar but not my work app calendar. Finally like some of the ideas below of changing to a 24h calendar.",1,1

Please add an option to enable things in the 'planned' to 'my day' makes life a lot easier. It'll make the app less stubborn and more user friendly!,2,1
Exactly what I was looking for to help establish routines. I like that I can set it to place habits on certain days and don't manually have to readd them. My only suggestion is to be able to manually sort items,2,2
"I like the app so far. One issue is like someone else said, why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14-day trial? Second, why don't the notifications pop up where I can see them? That was one of the main reasons that I got the app. I need to be constantly reminded of what I need to do. I have ADHD and remembering a bunch of things that I have to do is a HUGE issue.",1,1
You should keep recurring tasks for free. That is the only reason I left using your app four years ago and started to use google keep. Everything else is great.,2,2
"Looking as everyone else's very +ve reviews. I seem to be the odd one out but I didn't find it straightforward. It is too easy to delete a list (on my S9 at least) with even a slight bit of a swipe.

"I miss the Today, Week & All shortcuts that Wunderlist had at the top. The Planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance. The automated transfer seems to have worked well so far. UPDATE: Sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed ASAP. Wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk, hopefully To Do has put a stop to that.",1,1

"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it.

I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",0,0

"Seriously impressed with such a simple app. It's helped me go from writing list after lists in notebooks and losing them, to having it all on my phone whilst I'm out and about. Very convenient! I've already recommended to everyone I know who is like me with staying organized. Also being pregnant and having baby brain I find it hard to remember to take medication, so having a little reminder instead of an alarm is really handy. The snooze options are a wicked bonus. Thank you 🤩",2,2
Great apps to organize and manage task and practice habbit.,2,2
"Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do",0,0
Best productivity App till now🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠,2,2
"Great app so long as you only use the free version which only tracks 5 x habits. Used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid £9.49 for the platinum version so I could sync to other devices. Really disappointed that the sync option won't work, and software support is non existent. For an expensive app I would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help!",1,1
Long time user...do not like the latest changes! Changing the location of the remind feature is very frustrating. Now I keep clicking on the wrong option because it is in the same place as the remind feature used to be. Please change back...,1,1

NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,0,0
I really like the app. Maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more,1,1
"really no callender view without premium? Like really bro other apps do that for free so I think I'll just use one of those apps instead, I'd get it if it was a one time purchase like a DLC in a video game but a 2,99€ monthly subscription? that's just ludicrous",0,0
Great way to visualize daily schedule in a more intuitive way,2,2

It would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit..try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app . Well built interface with motivational images loved it❤,2,2

Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.",1,1
"It would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest, and even recommend books, etc. Also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are, and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow (for example, read book requires a picture of a book with your face, or run requires a tracking through the GPS to actually verify yoy ran) in this way it can even be competitive",1,1
"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",1,1

For some weird reason the app (timer) stopped working after a few months of installing the app. I used to use it everyday but now all I can do is uninstall it. it's kinda weird how this is an editors choice app. I would give this a five star if this was fixed. and it would be much better if this was not a timer.

This is my favourite app!❤ the plants are so cute and it really makes me so motivated to study! I am also very happy with the tags ! :) But i have a question.. If i am going to change to a new phone but with the same SD card.. Will all my plants be gone?,2,2
still trying,1,1
I love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines. I wish I could view my month or week at a glance however so I can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine.,2,2
Not for me,1,1
I enjoy the countdown to my next event. Very helpful.,2,2
"The app does not allow to switch from monthly view to agenda with one touch only. I have to slide the page, find agenda in the list and then can switch. Google calendar does this only by touching the top of the page. Can you make this happen in the next update?",1,2
"Really helpful app. I've looked at lots of other schedule apps, but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely. Great for making routines! Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.",2,2
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.,0,0

"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for.",0,0

In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service?

"The app is awesome. Really wish you could tag and name trees before you plant them. That would be a nice quality-of-life change. Also, if you could make the app more compatible for chromebooks, that would be nice too. Chromebooks are excellent work computers and I need a good working app on it. I really hope forest can work in the future.",2,2

Good app does exactly what it says it will I like that cause it's hard to find nowadays,2,2
Great app for the most part. Would be nice if each project a person could list goals till completion as well as being able to have a separate tasks list. One for home versus one for work.,1,1
"After the latest update, the forest has been removed. Coin count and tree purchase history is up-to-date, but the entire forest is gone. Synchronization does not fix the issue. I did not reinstall app as per the in-app warning not to. What the hell? Update: after two weeks issue was fixed",2,2
Very Good!,2,2
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted.",1,1

"I am very bad at just starting something and staying with it for a decent amount of time, or at least enough to get it done. This really really helps me in that aspect because I can set reminders, I got the fancy version, that will ping at me whenever I want them to to tell me to work on stuff. Also, every time I look at my little baby tree growing, I kno ""okay I just have this much longer and then I can take a break"" and honestly that is helping me.

A new isdue has cropped up. When editing a multiday event that you want to extend 1 more day you must include two additional days in order gor the app to show the one additional day you wish added. Most strange issue,1,1
Money hungry devs want about $5/mo for simple features... That's about $60/year for the fully functional organizer app. Other than that it seems nice so far.,2,2
Go overall application. I wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button. Everything else works really well.,2,2

"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises.

"PREVIOUSLY: The best to-do app by a million billion miles! I have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability- excellent system. 26/10/19 UPDATE: This major update to your app is, for me, unfortunately counter intuitive, poor and makes my life harder! I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",1,1
Does everything it says it does. I use it on my phone and my tablet for 5 years now. Wish I there was a desktop edition to sync with it. And would be nice if there were saved searches. Seems like that would be easy to implement and so helpful for the users!,2,2

Whenever the screen changes orientation or Auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and I have to reopen the one I was working with. Very annoying. Update; My opinion of the app is unchanged, but snarky respones from the developer are uncalled for. I get it, it's free, and I'm not using a lower end device.

Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,2,2

Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates.",1,1

I would like to be able to resize the fonts and spacing. 4. Creating tasks via WhatsApp or Google assistant is very limited in its possibilities and often erroneous.",1,1
"This app is fine in concept, but the ""game"" part of Habitica, arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps, is just too boring and not that ""gamey"" to me, which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits. Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired.",1,1
good app that does it's supposed to. wish it had some improvements to make it great (suggestions in the in-app forum),2,1
"I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.",2,2

"I have been using this app for about a year now without any issues, so I'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu. I find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable (Hope it will be implemented again soon). Also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine. As I have to change the time of every item to move it down. I would prefer the old version, hopefully it all gets fixed soon.",1,1
Amazing user intrrface,2,2
Great app! Highly recommend it! I just wish this app would show the sub tasks in the to-do list.,2,2
Its a nice app a plesent representation of what you put in your task list to-do list or meeting list . Learning the app and for myself getting everything to sync up properly took a little bit of patience but I got it and all's good.,2,2
Wish you could sync Google Calendar.,1,1
Very pleased with the product! I do however have one suggestion: possibility to pick location directly from the maps would be nice.,2,2
"Great app! But have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market! Trust me people are looking for this! 1) The ability to add your schedule with a few clicks. For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)",2,1

"This is unforgivably close to perfect. Why no timer? So many tasks are long-term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit.

"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform.",1,1
Excellent idea but doesn't really work as intended. All I do is use the app when I know I definitely won't need my phone and obviously this isn't what it was designed for. I'm not using my phone less at all. Really the tree's should be continuously planted and then when you use your phone the current tree growing dies as this will put people off using there phone if they see that there is only several minutes left for the current tree to finish growing.,0,0

"Nice calandar easy to use, there's one thing and that is the lack of a good notification on the screen. I mist a few appointments because of that so I deleted the calendar. I really liked it but I need a good warning system!",1,1
Would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. The calendar widget is a complete failure. It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. The whole reason I subscribed to this app was because I needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.,0,2
Works great!! Keeps me focused and off my phone!! I've tried many different apps like this before and deleted them because they didn't work how I wanted to or they put ads on my homescreen. But this is app doesn't do that and this is the best one around for sure!:),2,2

"meh I left the ""meh"" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the ""themes"" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed.

"This task app is the only decent option I've found for combining tasks and calendar events into one scrollable widget. Tasks can be set to repeat from the date completed, which is essential for things like haircuts and cleaning schedules. Unfortunately, neither the app nor the widget (which is especially important) has many customization options. One option I would like, in particular, is the ability to hide the widget's title bar. Obviously color and display options would be nice, too.",1,1

This is a huge problem for me and definitely a deal breaker. If this can't be resolved I'll have to start looking elsewhere for a calendar.

It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing.

"Amazing planner! I've been using the desktop version linked with my Google calendar and it was working great! Now with the app, it's even better than I thought it would be! I love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use! I especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks! It has helped me stay on task with work, cleaning, and everything else!",2,2
Could you allow me to add activities on my timeline because my routine and plan is always changing and cannot be limited to a fixed routine. I use this as a daily planner to plan out my full days and weeks ahead of time so it would be good if i can add activities far ahead of time.,2,2

Terrible! I transferred all my lists from Google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didn't save! So beyond frustrating.,0,0
Works great at keeping me organized. I have not had it long so I will have to explore the features. Update-New phone. I can now use the microphone to add tasks. This app is just smart enough. I use it as my own personal to do list separate from Google Tasks which I use for work. It's simple with just enough features and not all the predictive noise threaded through all Google apps.,2,2

If only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due. So if I created 5 events to go off in an hr I'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone. It's not needed. Or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it.,2,2

Great for organizing milestones and to do lists,2,2
Needed a replacement for Wunderlist. Looked at several disappointing options before finding TickTick. It has everything I liked about Wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of Wunderlist's annoying behaviors. It also did the best job importing from Wunderlist. The best alternative to Wunderlist. Period.,2,2
"The app notification doesn't go away even after ticking the task complete, otherwise an amazing app",1,1
"This was a great app for productivity but it was initially difficult to navigate through. Once I figured it out it still took a bit of time to set up and keep track to. If you've used baby of these, this interface is beautiful but it takes some time getting used to the input and progress.",2,1

"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one.

So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",2,2

Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day.

For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)",2,1

Very exciting app. Very helpful for my daily or weekly shedule. 🌟🌟🌟🌟👍👍👍👍,2,2

its a good calendar! . Definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up Ill continue to use it.

"Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel.",2,2
free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it... just to see if i will use it consistently,2,2

Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics.
